# Climate's Relationship with Asthma Hospitalization Rates 

# Project Description

The dataset that our group will be working with will be **Current Weather Data**, **Historical Weather Data**, **Air Pollution**, **Asthma Hospitalization Rates in California**, and **Wild Fires**. All of our members partook in collecting the data that [relates to weather](https://openweathermap.org/api), data that [relates to air pollution](https://www.airvisual.com/air-pollution-data-api), data that [relates to wildfires](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires), and data that portrays [Asthma hospitalization rates in California](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/asthma-and-myocardial-infarction-inpatient-hospitalization-and-emergency-room-visit-c-2000-2009). The weather data was created to keep track of past, present weather patterns, forecasts of weather, as well as air pollution status around the world. The wild fire data was created to keep track of past wild fires and to see which locations are most like to have a wildfire. The asthma hospitalization data was created by the government to determine asthma patients in local areas of California. The air pollution data was created to determine local and global air quality for environmental safety.

Our target audience will be those with asthma as we will be looking into comparing each data sets and comparing the asthma data set to them in order to visualize how weather patterns, air pollution, and/or wildfires affect asthma diagnostic rates.

**We are aiming to answer questions such as:**

- What is the relationship between wildfires, air pollution, and asthma hospitalization in California?

- What is the relationship between historical weather changes and asthma hospitalization in California?

- What is the relationship between air pollution changes and asthma hospitalization in California?

# Technical Description

We will be using APIs, such as the _Weather Data API_, _Air pollution API_, and _Asthma hospitalization API_, as well as the _wild fire data set_ to read in our data and we will be needing to reshape and reformat all of our APIs in order to answer our specific questions. We will using R packages such as  **tidyverse, leaflet, ggplot2, plotly, shiny, sunburstR, dygraphs** in order to create creative data visualizations for our project.
